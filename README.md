Radio Edge Cloud
================

This repository contains the Akraino Radio Edge Cloud blueprint which is
intended to consumed by the Akraino Regional Controller in order to deploy the
software of the Akraino Telco Appliance blueprint familiy in a prescribed manner
onto a tested hardware configuration.

The REC blueprint may also be deployed in a semi-manual manner without the aid
of the Regional Controller, and may be deployed on hardware other than the
tested configurations, but in that case it will not be the full "appliance" that
conforms with a hardware+software configuration that was tested by the REC
Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
