Radio Edge Cloud
================

This repository contains the Akraino Radio Edge Cloud blueprint which is 
intended to consumed by the Akraino Regional Controller in order to deploy the 
software of the Akraino Telco Appliance blueprint familiy in a prescribed manner 
onto a tested hardware configuration.

The REC blueprint may also be deployed in a semi-manual manner without the aid 
of the Regional Controller, and may be deployed on hardware other than the 
tested configurations, but in that case it will not be the full "appliance" that 
conforms with a hardware+software configuration that was tested by the REC 
Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
